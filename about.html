                        <h2>My Story</h2>
                        <p>Born and raised in Maputo, Mozambique, my journey into technology began at the Portuguese School of Mozambique, where I discovered my passion for problem-solving and innovation. This passion led me to Portugal in 2016, where I pursued an Integrated Master's degree in Engineering and Management of Information Systems at the University of Minho.</p>
                        <p>During my academic journey, I immersed myself in the world of Big Data and distributed systems, working as a Research Grant holder at ISISE where I built and managed a Hadoop cluster for processing sensor data from road pavements. This experience sparked my fascination with infrastructure and large-scale data processing.</p>
                        <p>Currently, I'm part of the Programa Contacto at MC Digital (Sonae), where I work as a Platform Engineer, managing cloud infrastructure, automating deployments, and ensuring the reliability of critical systems that power one of Portugal's largest retail operations.</p>
                        <h3>What I Do</h3>
                        <p>As a Platform Engineer, I bridge the gap between development and operations, creating robust infrastructure that enables teams to deliver value faster and more reliably. My work involves:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 1rem; list-style: disc; padding-left: 2rem;">
                            <li>Designing and implementing Infrastructure as Code using Terraform for Azure environments</li>
                            <li>Managing Linux systems and automating repetitive tasks with Ansible and Bash scripting</li>
                            <li>Configuring Big Data platforms including Hadoop, Databricks, and Cloudera</li>
                            <li>Providing technical support and solving complex infrastructure challenges</li>
                            <li>Ensuring security and compliance across all platform deployments</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">I believe in the power of automation to eliminate toil and enable engineers to focus on what truly matters: solving interesting problems and delivering value to users.</p>
